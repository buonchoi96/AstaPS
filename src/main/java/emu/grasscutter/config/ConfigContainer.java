     *              The field for 'legacyResources' has been removed.
     * Version  7 - 'regionKey' is being added for authentication
     *              with the new dispatch server.
     * Version  8 - 'server' is being added for enforcing handbook server
     *              addresses.
     * Version  9 - 'limits' was added for handbook requests.
     * Version 10 - 'trialCostumes' was added for enabling costumes
     *              on trial avatars.
     * Version 11 - 'server.fastRequire' was added for disabling the new
     *              Lua script require system if performance is a concern.
     * Version 12 - 'http.startImmediately' was added to control whether the
     *              HTTP server should start immediately.
     * Version 13 - 'game.useUniquePacketKey' was added to control whether the
     *              encryption key used for packets is a constant or randomly generated.
     * Version 14 - 'server.threadPools' was added for managed thread-pool sizing.
     * Version 15 - 'server.watchdog' was added for the database monitor and timed restart.
